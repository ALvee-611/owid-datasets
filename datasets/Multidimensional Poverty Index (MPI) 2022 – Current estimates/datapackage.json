  "description": "The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an international measure of acute multidimensional poverty covering over 100 developing countries. It complements traditional monetary poverty measures by capturing the acute deprivations in health, education, and living standards that a person faces simultaneously.\n\nThe MPI assesses poverty at the individual level. If a person is deprived in a third or more of ten (weighted) indicators, the global MPI identifies them as ‘MPI poor’. The extent – or intensity – of their poverty is also measured through the percentage of deprivations they are experiencing.\n\nThe ten indicators and their weights are: nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance (1/6), cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing and assets (1/18).\n\nIf a survey dataset is missing any of the 10 indicators that make up the global MPI, then that indicator cannot be used in the computation of the poverty measure. Indicator weights are re-adjusted accordingly, such that each dimension continues to be given a weight of one-third. For example, if suppose one living standards indicator is missing. In that case, while originally each of the living standards indicators received a relative weight of 1/18 (5.56%), the remaining indicators will receive a relative weight of 1/15 (6.66%). If one health or education indicator is missing, the other indicator will receive the full weight of one-third. If both indicators in health or education are missing, the dataset does not qualify to be included in the global MPI.\n\nThe global MPI shows who is poor and how they are poor and can be used to create a comprehensive picture of people living in poverty. It permits comparisons both across countries and world regions, and within countries by ethnic group, urban/rural area, subnational region, and age group, as well as other key household and community characteristics. For each group and for countries as a whole, the composition of MPI by each of the 10 indicators shows how people are poor.\n\nThis makes the MPI and its linked information platform invaluable as an analytical tool to identify the most vulnerable people – the poorest among the poor, revealing poverty patterns within countries and over time, enabling policy makers to target resources and design policies more effectively.\n\nThe global MPI was developed by OPHI with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) for inclusion in UNDP’s flagship Human Development Report in 2010. It has been published annually by OPHI and in the HDRs ever since.\n\nThis is the CME dataset, with \"current margin estimates\", which are essentially the regular global MPI in OPHI's publications.",

A larger figure represents a higher level of poverty.\n\nBeing ‘MPI poor’ means that a person is deprived in a third or more of ten weighted indicators across three dimensions: health (indicators: nutrition, child mortality), education (indicators: years of schooling, school attendance) and living standards (indicators: cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets).\n\nHouseholds are assessed as being deprived in a given indicator if they do not meet a certain welfare threshold specific to that indicator. For instance, a household is deprived in the 'Years of Schooling' indicator if no household member has completed five years of schooling.\n\nThe weights are allocated across indicators so as to give an equal weighting to each within its own dimension, and an equal total weighting to each dimension in the overall calculation. (Health and education dimensions are given a weight of 1/6, while the indicators within the living standards dimension are given a weight of 1/18.)\n\nIf a survey dataset is missing any of the 10 indicators that make up the global MPI, then that indicator cannot be used in the computation of the poverty measure. Indicator weights are re-adjusted accordingly, such that each dimension continues to be given a weight of one-third. For example, if suppose one living standards indicator is missing. In that case, while originally each of the living standards indicators received a relative weight of 1/18 (5.56%), the remaining indicators will receive a relative weight of 1/15 (6.66%). If one health or education indicator is missing, the other indicator will receive the full weight of one-third. If both indicators in health or education are missing, the dataset does not qualify to be included in the global MPI.\n\nThe intensity of multidimensional poverty is calculated as the average share of indicators in which those counted as MPI poor are deprived (using the same weights to calculate the average). This is an important complementary measure to the  the share of population who are MPI poor (the 'incidence' of MPI poverty). An example given by the researchers who calculate the MPI data serves to illustrate this well: \n\n'Imagine two countries: in both, 30 per cent of people are poor (incidence).
