# Population (Gapminder, HYDE & UN)

Population data by country is taken from Version 6 of Gapminder. This provides data by country from 1800 through to 1949. The Gapminder dataset is available online at http://www.gapminder.org/.

The regional, and world, long-run population series was constructed by Our World in Data based on two key sources: the HYDE database (2016) and UN's World Population Prospects (2019). 

- HYDE (2016) data is used from the year -10,000 to 1940
- UN World Population Prospects (2019) from 1950 to 2019; 
- Projections to 2100 from the UN World Population Prospects (2019)

HYDE regions have been aggregated to match with UN regional groupings:
- 'Europe' and 'CIS' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Europe'
- 'Asia' and 'Middle East' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Asia'

HYDE Database, available at: https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/basicdrivingfactors/population/index-2.html

From 1950 to 2019, country, region, and world estimates come from the UN Population Revision (2019), and projections to 2100 from the UN Population Revision (2019) medium variant scenario.
