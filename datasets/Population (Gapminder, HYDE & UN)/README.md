# Population (Gapminder, HYDE & UN)

Population data by country, region, and for the world, was constructed by Our World in Data based on three key sources:

- HYDE (2016) data is used from the year -10,000 to 1790;
- Gapminder Version 6 from 1800 to 1949;
- UN World Population Prospects (2019) estimates from 1950 to 2021; 
- UN World Population Prospects (2019) projections (medium variant scenario) from 2022 to 2100.
