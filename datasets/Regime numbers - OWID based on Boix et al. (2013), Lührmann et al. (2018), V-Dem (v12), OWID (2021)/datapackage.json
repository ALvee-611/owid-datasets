(2018) using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (v12), and expanding the data and refining the classification ourselves.\n\nThe classification by Boix et al. (2013) distinguishes between democracies and non-democracies.\n\nThe Regimes of the World classification distinguishes between closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies.
