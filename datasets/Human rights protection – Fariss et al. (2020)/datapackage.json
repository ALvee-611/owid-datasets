It aims to measure how a government protects its citizens' physical integrity, by taking into account torture, government killing, political imprisonment, extrajudicial executions, mass killings and disappearances. Its values range from  −3.8 to around 5.4 (the higher the better). It is constructed from an econometric model with data from nine sources.",
