# Political regimes - OWID based on Boix et al. (2013), V-Dem (v12), and Lührmann et al. (2018)

This dataset provides information on political regimes, using data from Boix et al. (2013), the Varieties of Democracy project (v11.1), and the Regimes of the World classification from Lührmann et al. (2018).

We expand the countries and years covered, and refine the coding of the Regimes of the World classification. You can read a detailed description of the data in this post: https://ourworldindata.org/regimes-of-the-world-data
