  "description": "This dataset provides information on political regimes, using the Regimes of the World classification from Lührmann et al. (2018), data from the Varieties of Democracy project (v11.1), and expanding the data and refining the classification ourselves.\n\nThe classification distinguishes between closed autocracies (numeric score of 0), electoral autocracies (score of 1), electoral democracies (score of 2), and liberal democracies (score of 3).\n\nIn closed autocracies, citizens do not have the right to either choose the chief executive of the government or the legislature through multi-party elections.\n\nIn electoral autocracies, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression, that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair. \n\nIn electoral democracies, citizens have the right to participate in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections. \n\nIn liberal democracies, citizens have further individual and minority rights, are equal before the law, and the actions of the executive are constrained by the legislative and the courts.\n\nThe data comes from the Varieties of Democracy project, which is based on expert assessments. \n\nWe expand the years and countries covered and refine the coding rules.\n\nYou can read a detailed description of the data in this post: https://ourworldindata.org/regimes-of-the-world-data\n\nYou can download the code and complete dataset, including supplementary variables, from GitHub: https://github.com/owid/notebooks/tree/main/BastianHerre/political_regimes",
