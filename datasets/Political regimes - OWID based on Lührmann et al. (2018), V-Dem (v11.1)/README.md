# Political regimes - OWID based on Lührmann et al. (2018), V-Dem (v11.1)

This dataset provides information on political regimes, using the Regimes of the World classification from Lührmann et al. (2018), data from the Varieties of Democracy project (v11.1), and expanding the data and refining the classification ourselves.

The classification distinguishes between closed autocracies (numeric score of 0), electoral autocracies (score of 1), electoral democracies (score of 2), and liberal democracies (score of 3).

In closed autocracies, citizens do not have the right to either choose the chief executive of the government or the legislature through multi-party elections.

In electoral autocracies, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression, that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair. 

In electoral democracies, citizens have the right to participate in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections. 

In liberal democracies, citizens have further individual and minority rights, are equal before the law, and the actions of the executive are constrained by the legislative and the courts.

The data comes from the Varieties of Democracy project, which is based on expert assessments. 

We expand the years and countries covered and refine the coding rules.
