It distinguishes between non-electoral autocracies (score 0), one-party autocracies (score 1), multi-party autocracies without elected executive (score 2), multi-party autocracies (score 3), exclusive democracies (score 4), male democracies (score 5), and electoral democracies (score 6, including polyarchies).\n\nIn non-electoral autocracies, citizens do not have the right to elect the chief executive or the legislature.\n\nIn one-party autocracies, some citizens have the right to choose the chief executive or the legislature, but only have one choice.\n\nMultiparty autocracies without an elected executive are otherwise one-party autocracies, but the chief executive of the government is not elected even if citizens have more than one choice in legislative elections.\n\nMultiparty autocracies are one-party autocracies in which citizens have more than one choice, though election outcome is certain.\n\nIn exclusive democracies, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature in multi-party, uncertain elections, but suffrage is restricted.\n\nMale democracies are exclusive democracies that have comprehensive suffrage for men.\n\nElectoral democracies are male democracies that also have comprehensive suffrage for women.\n\nIt matches the variable lexical_index in Skaaning et al.
