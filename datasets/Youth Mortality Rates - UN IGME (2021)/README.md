# Youth Mortality Rates - UN IGME (2021)

Youth Mortality Rates measures the share of newborns who die before reaching a given age. 

This dataset was constructed by Our World in Data based on data from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME).

We define and calculate the 'youth mortality' for different age cut-offs based on the combination of:
- under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)
-  5-14 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 15).

All of these metrics are available from the UN IGME (2021). Based on these estimates we calculate 'youth mortality': the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of 15.
