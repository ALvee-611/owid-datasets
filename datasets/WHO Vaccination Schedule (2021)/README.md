# WHO Vaccination Schedule (2021)

This dataset shows vaccines that are administered through national immunization schedules: where countries provide and recommend vaccines through routine services. This does not mean all children are vaccinated – countries vary in their vaccination coverage. 

The 'Not administered' category does not necessarily mean the vaccines are unavailable – they may be optional or available commercially, but they are not included in the national immunization schedule.

This dataset should be next updated by the source by November 2022. We will update it on Our World in Data soon after the new version is published. At the link above you can directly access the source page and see the latest available data.
