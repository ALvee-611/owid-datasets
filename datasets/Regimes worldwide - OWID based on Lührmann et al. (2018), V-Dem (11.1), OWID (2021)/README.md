# Regimes worldwide - OWID based on Lührmann et al. (2018), V-Dem (11.1), OWID (2021)

This dataset provides worldwide information on the number of political regimes and the populations living under them.

Political regimes are identified using the Regimes of the World classification from Lührmann et al. (2018), data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (v11.1), and expanding the data and refining the classification ourselves.

The classification distinguishes between closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies.

Population data comes from our own calculations based on Gapminder (v6), HYDE (v3.2), and UN (2019).
