  "description": "This dataset provides information on the number of countries having different political systems.\n\nPolitical regimes are identified using either Boix et al. (2013), or the Regimes of the World classification from Lührmann et al. (2018) using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (v11.1), and expanding the data and refining the classification ourselves.\n\nThe classification by Boix et al. (2013) distinguishes between democracies and non-democracies.\n\nThe Regimes of the World classification distinguishes between closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies.
