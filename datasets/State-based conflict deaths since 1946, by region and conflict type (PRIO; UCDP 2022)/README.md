# State-based conflict deaths since 1946, by region and conflict type (PRIO; UCDP 2022)

The UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset provides data on direct deaths arising from conflicts that resulted in more than 25 deaths and involved the government of a state on at least one side. Both civilian and military deaths are included. Deaths due to disease or famine caused by conflict, as well as extra-judicial killings in custody, are excluded. This dataset begins in 1989 and aims to have global coverage.

The data is organised by year and 'dyad' (a pairing of participants who are the opposing combatants in a conflict). 

We aggregate this to provide total numbers of deaths each year, broken down by the conflict type and region. Note that in this dataset the region refers not (necessarily) to where fighting and deaths took place, but rather to the location of the 'incompatibility' between the participants that defines the conflict: usually the country or territory whose possession or governance is in dispute.

To extend the data back further in time we rely on the PRIO Battledeaths Datset, produced according to the same definitions and structure as the UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset. The PRIO data runs from 1946 to 2008 and is no longer maintained. We aggregated the PRIO data in the same way as the UCDP data, and then constructed a final joint series which consists of the PRIO data from 1946 to 1988 and the UCDP data from 1989 onwards.
