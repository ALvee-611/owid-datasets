It provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) versus only 2000 from Ember. However, BP does not provide data for all countries and is not as up-to-date as Ember data.\n\nSo, where data from Ember is available for a given country or year, we rely on it as the primary source. But we supplement this with data from BP where it's not available.\n\n2021 electricity data is currently only available for European countries based on the latest European Electricity Review.\n\nOur World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by the total electricity production.",
